### Expression

$
h(\mathbf{x}) = \max(\mathbf{W}_1 \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_1, \mathbf{W}_2 \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{W}_k \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_k)
$

### 1. Enhanced Expressive Power
Maxout's capability to approximate any **convex function** grants neural networks a significant degree of flexibility and expressive power. This means Maxout units can learn anything from simple linear responses to very complex nonlinear patterns. This capability is particularly useful in applications where the decision boundaries are complex or when the data distribution is highly variable.

### 2. Comparison with ReLU
Compared to ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Maxout offers a broader range of functionalities. ReLU is a simple yet highly effective activation function defined as $f(x)=max(0,x)$. Its main advantages include computational simplicity and mitigation of the vanishing gradient problem. However, ReLU is single-sided active, meaning it only activates for positive inputs. In contrast, Maxout can adapt to both positive and negative changes in inputs, providing a more complex nonlinear response.

### 3. Trade-offs in Practical Applications
While Maxout offers superior theoretical performance, it also brings higher parameter burden (multiple sets of weights per neuron), which can lead to higher computational costs and increased risk of overfitting. Therefore, the choice of activation function in practice often involves a trade-off among expressive power, computational efficiency, and ease of use.
